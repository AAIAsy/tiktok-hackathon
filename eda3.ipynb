      "997. TEXT: I have been meaning to get over to Gallo Blanco for sometime now but always end up going to their sister restaurant Otro Cafe. So glad we decided to do dinner here last night! Immediately upon entering Gallo I was really impressed with the space and the vibe. The space itself is just gorgeous, it's much bigger than I imagined it to be. When I initially saw some reviews with pictures posted of the interior and the large food menu posted over a counter I thought this was a restaurant that you ordered at the counter and then took your food and sat down. I wasn't sure if that was an experience I was looking to have. It is in fact a full service restaurant. I was guilty of judging a book by it's cover! We were greeted by a server who let us know that they were on a 30 minute wait (7:15 ish on a Friday night, which seems about right) but that the bar was open seating and we were welcome to eat in there, grab a drink, or just wait for a table. We decided to wait for a table and we were pleasantly surprised to be sat within about 5 minutes of being there. SCORE!!! We ordered the Chip and Guac salsa sampler to start with which was awesome. I loved the different salsas that complimented the guac and the chips are always on point! For our main entrees we ordered the chicken enchiladas a couple of carne asada tacos. Everything is so flavorful. I am a huge fan of Otro Cafe especially the flour tortillas which are out of this world AMAZING so I was a little bummed that my tacos weren't wrapped in those heavenly numbers. The only con's I have to share would be the noise level. With the beautiful construction of the space the noise carries so if you're trying to have a quiet intimate dinner this may not be the place to do that. There is also patio seating which I imagine would be a better option to dine if you're looking for less noise. Parking I can imagine could also be an issue especially as we get into these gorgeous nights that we are so famous for in AZ. Overall I loved Gallo Blanco's and can't wait to come back and try out some other items on their menu!\n",

I find the atmosphere very relaxing and comfortable with the staff always being polite and helpful. Drink refills are offered around the time I need one, and to my surprise towards the end of a meal I never feel like they're rushing me out. On my last visit here I came on my girlfriend's birthday, not expecting anything for it being that restaurants like this rarely sing or give free desserts.  And although it was at the end of the night and somewhat close to closing we were both surprised when our waitress came out singing and giving her a free serving of Chinese donuts with a candle sticking out of one. If you've never been here before I can't recommend the Orange Beef enough. It is a standout item of the menu. And if you plan on treating yourself, definitely order yourself the cream cheese wonton appetizer. Next time we visit we are planning on trying the drink menu, on this last trip the anticipation for the food distracted us.\n",

Maybe I should say the food is terrible so I can keep this restaurant as my own little secret, but I can't do that. If you want authentic Mexican food - you have to come here!!!!

I said I would like to talk to someone that had time to listen. She got an attitude and said call my bank and hung up on me. I am now not only going to call my bank, but I am am also going to get a lawyer. They had to have manually entered my card number.

I've always had my issues going to the dentist to get major work done and she explained everything in detail and made my smile on my two front teeth back to normal. The coloration match for the feelings were perfect and pristine as if they were my original  two front teeth. She definitely has the Magic Touch when it comes to dental perfection. Stacy her assistant was a pleasure to have working also on my teeth. They both made me feel very comfortable after having nothing done other than cleanings for quite a few years. And if you're ever in need of a root canal she is the only one I would recommend to have do it, it was my first root canal and I don't know why people say they're so bad because it was painless having her do the work on it and never felt uncomfortable or in pain. So if you're in need of any dental work, your go-to dentist should be Dr. Jessica V at Desert Dentistry in Ahwatukee. Ray L.\n",
