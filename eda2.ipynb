This caused my clearance to continue donating to be delayed for 13 weeks the first time she did this and somehow 7 more weeks the second time. The doctor whom reviews the documents to see if you're cleared was not able to view mine due to VICKI FILING MY SIGNED DOCUMENTS TO THE WRONG PLACE AND AGAIN THIS HAPPENED TWICE BY HER.
